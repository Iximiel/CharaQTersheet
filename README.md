CharaQTersheet
==============

I'm setting up a small character sheet for dnd 3.5, using qt5.0+

v 0.1 I finished to work on a class viewer tool that shoiuld be useful in future development. to make it work copy the files in the directory "FtCitWD" in the work directory.

Now i'm working on the core of the program: the character sheet in v 0.02 we should see some bio,  and abilities, without the use of classes, just as the paper sheet, in v0.03 i will add skills and in  v 0.04 i will add a small equipment addon and a feat one too, but just as list of things.
